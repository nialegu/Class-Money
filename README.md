Money
---
In this program, we have two classes which present us two currencies - dollars and old format's sterlings.

In **Dollars** class money values are requested from the user and then convert from an *array of characters* to a *long double* type. You can perform any standart arithmetic operations on them using overloaded operations defined in the class.<br> 
If you want to display them, the special method converse money values back from *long double* to *character array*.

In **Sterlings** class money values are requested from the user in old writing system, where:<br>
1 pound = 20 shellings<br>
1 shelling = 12 pence<br>
You can perform any standart arithmetic operations on them using overloaded operations defined in the class. Also you can convert sterling's value to a decimal format which is a new system. 

Finally, you can transform classes values to each other - sterlings to dollars and back.
